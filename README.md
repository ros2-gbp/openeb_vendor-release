# openeb_vendor

Wrapper package to build the [Prophesee OpenEB](https://github.com/prophesee-ai/openeb)
library (Metavision SDK) on the ROS2 build farm.

Note:
The patch to build the [SilkyEVCam plugin](https://centuryarks.com/en/download/) has been suspended for
now since it disables the Prophesee sensors!
